CIFAS is a fraud prevention service in the UK. A "CIFAS marker" on your credit file means an organisation believes you have been involved in fraud or are a victim of fraud.

The most common type is a "Protective Registration" (where you ask for it to prevent ID theft), but a "Misuse of Facility" marker (e.g., using a bank account for money laundering) can virtually ban you from obtaining any financial products for six years.
