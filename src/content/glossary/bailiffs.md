Commonly known as "bailiffs," the official legal term is now **Enforcement Agent**. These are individuals legally authorised to collect debts on behalf of creditors.

They have the legal power to visit your home to remove and sell goods to pay off debts such as Council Tax arrears, parking fines, or County Court Judgments (CCJs). However, they usually cannot force entry into your home for most types of debt unless you have let them in previously or they have specific court authority (such as for criminal fines or tax debts). You should typically seek advice immediately if an enforcement agent contacts you.
