Bailiffs are legally authorised agents who can visit your home to remove goods to sell if you have outstanding court fines or specific types of priority debt (like Council Tax or parking fines).

They must follow strict rules and cannot just enter your property unless the door is unlocked. Their powers are limited, and they should be dealt with via a debt charity.
