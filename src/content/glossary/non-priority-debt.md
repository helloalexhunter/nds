Non-priority debts are those where the creditor has less immediate power to take your home or essential services. While you are still liable for the money and can be taken to court (resulting in a CCJ), the immediate consequences are less severe than priority debts.

Examples include:

- Credit card debts.
- Unsecured personal loans.
- Water bill arrears.
- Overdrafts.
- Catalogue debts.
