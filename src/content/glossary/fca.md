The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is the regulator for financial services in the UK. They set the rules that banks, lenders, and debt collection agencies must follow.

If a firm treats you unfairly or breaks FCA rules (such as harassing you or ignoring a vulnerability), you can complain to the firm and then to the Financial Ombudsman Service.
