A Default Notice is a formal letter from a creditor warning you that your account is about to default because you are behind on payments.

It is a requirement under the Consumer Credit Act. The notice will give you at least 14 days to pay the arrears to bring your account back up to date. If you do not pay within this time, the account defaults, usually resulting in the debt being sold to a collection agency and a default being registered on your credit file for six years.
