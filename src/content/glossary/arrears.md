"Arrears" refers to the amount of money you have missed on regular payments. If you miss your rent or council tax payment, you are said to be "in arrears".

It is distinct from the _total_ balance. For example, you might owe £100,000 on your mortgage total, but if you missed last month's payment of £500, your _arrears_ are £500. Dealing with arrears is usually the first priority in debt advice.
