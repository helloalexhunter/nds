A County Court Judgment (CCJ) is a court order in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland that might be registered against you if you fail to repay money you owe.

If you receive a CCJ, it means the court has formally decided that you owe the money. The judgment will detail how much you owe, how to pay (in full or instalments), and the deadline. A CCJ stays on your credit file for six years, making it difficult to get credit in the future. If you pay the full amount within one month, you can get the judgment removed from the register.
