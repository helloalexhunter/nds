An Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) is a formal, legally binding agreement between you and your creditors to pay back your debts over a period of time (usually 5 or 6 years).

It must be set up by a qualified professional called an Insolvency Practitioner. In an IVA, you make affordable monthly payments, and at the end of the term, any remaining unsecured debt is written off. It stops creditors from taking further legal action against you, but it will negatively affect your credit rating for six years.
