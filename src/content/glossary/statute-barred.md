"Statute barred" refers to a debt that is too old to be enforced through the courts. In England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, most debts become statute barred if:

1. 1 - The creditor has not already taken you to court (obtained a CCJ).
2. 2 - You have not made a payment towards the debt in the last six years.
3. 3 - You have not written to the creditor acknowledging the debt in the last six years.

If a debt is statute barred, the debt technically still exists, but the creditor cannot take legal action to recover it.
