A Charging Order is a legal order that secures a debt against your home or other property. It usually follows a County Court Judgment (CCJ) that you haven't paid.

It turns an "unsecured" debt into a "secured" debt. This means if you sell your house or remortgage, the debt must be paid from the proceeds. In rare cases, a creditor can apply for an "Order for Sale" to force you to sell your home to pay the debt.
