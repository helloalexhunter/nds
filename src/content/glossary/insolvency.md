Insolvency is a legal state describing a situation where you cannot pay your debts when they are due, or where your total liabilities (debts) exceed your total assets.

Formal insolvency solutions in the UK include Bankruptcy, Individual Voluntary Arrangements (IVAs), and Debt Relief Orders (DROs).
