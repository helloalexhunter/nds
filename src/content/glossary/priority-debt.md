Priority debts are debts that carry the most serious consequences if you don't pay them. They should always be paid before "non-priority" debts like credit cards.

Examples of priority debts include:

- **Mortgage or Rent arrears** (risk of losing your home).
- **Council Tax arrears** (risk of bailiff action or imprisonment).
- **Gas/Electricity arrears** (risk of disconnection).
- **Court fines** (risk of enforcement action or imprisonment).
- **Child Maintenance**.
