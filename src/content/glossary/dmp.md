A Debt Management Plan (DMP) is an informal agreement between you and your creditors to pay back your non-priority debts. You pay one monthly payment to a DMP provider, who then divides it among your creditors.

Unlike an IVA or Bankruptcy, a DMP is not legally binding, meaning creditors can technically still contact you or take legal action, though most will agree to the plan if your offer is fair. You should ideally set up a DMP through a free provider (like StepChange or PayPlan) rather than a fee-charging company.
