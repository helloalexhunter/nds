A Debt Relief Order (DRO) is a way of dealing with debts if you have a relatively low amount of debt, little spare income, and few assets. It acts as a cheaper alternative to bankruptcy.

If your DRO is approved, your debt repayments stop for 12 months. If your financial situation hasn't improved at the end of that year, the debts included in the order are written off ("discharged"). To qualify, you must owe less than £50,000, have less than £75 per month disposable income, and have assets worth less than £2,000 (with a car worth no more than £4,000).
