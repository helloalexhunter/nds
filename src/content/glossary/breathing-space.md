Breathing Space is a government scheme that gives you legal protection from your creditors for up to 60 days.

During this time, most interest and penalty charges are frozen, and enforcement action must stop. It is designed to give you time to get debt advice and set up a solution without the pressure of chasing letters or calls. There is also a specific "Mental Health Crisis Breathing Space" which lasts for the duration of your treatment plus 30 days.
