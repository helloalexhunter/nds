        <h1>What National Debt Service is here to do</h1>
        <p class="text-base text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">
          National Debt Service is a small, independent website. It exists to signpost people in the
          UK to free, regulated debt advice and mental health support. That’s it. We don’t sell
          products, handle your case or share your details with anyone.

        <h2>A place to start, not a service in itself</h2>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">
          When money worries build up, it can be hard to know where to begin. There are lots of
          websites and adverts saying they can “wipe out debt” or “write off 80% of what you owe”.
          It’s easy to feel pushed into things when you’re already under pressure.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">
          This site takes a different approach. We don’t try to persuade you to choose any
          particular route. Instead, we point you towards free, regulated organisations and trusted
          sources of information in your country, so you can speak to people whose job it is to
          help.

        <h2>Why we mention different countries in the UK</h2>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">
          Debt rules and processes are not the same everywhere in the UK. England and Wales often
          share one set of rules, while Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own. Names,
          timeframes and legal terms can all change depending on where you live.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">
          That’s why we always signpost to organisations and information that are clear about which
          country they cover. For anything detailed or time-sensitive, services in your own country
          will always have the most up-to-date view.

        <h2>Accessibility and tone</h2>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">
          Money worries often come with tiredness, stress, anxiety and low mood. We try to write in
          simple, plain English so you don’t need lots of energy to understand the pages.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">
          The site is built with accessibility in mind: clear headings, readable font sizes and
          good colour contrast. If you spot something that makes the site hard to use, you can let
          us know on the contact page.
