        <p class="text-base text-slate-800 leading-relaxed max-w-none">
          National Debt Service is a small, independent website. It exists to
          help people in the UK find free, trusted debt and mental health
          support. We don’t sell products, give advice, handle cases or pass
          your details to anyone.

        <h2>Why this site exists</h2>

        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed max-w-none">
          Before my mental health took a turn, I was financially stable. My
          credit scores were in the high 900s, and I had no debts other than a
          mortgage. I managed my finances carefully and without difficulty.
        </p>

        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed max-w-none">
          In 2024, I experienced a serious mental health breakdown. During that
          period, I was unable to work, communicate properly, or manage
          day-to-day responsibilities. The financial system did not pause. Bills
          continued, credit was relied upon, and balances increased while I was
          unwell.
        </p>

        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed max-w-none">
          The debt I’m dealing with today is a direct result of that period of
          illness.
        </p>

        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed max-w-none">
          As I began recovery, with support from the NHS, therapy, and men’s
          mental health groups, I found it difficult to locate clear,
          trustworthy information in one place. Help existed, but it was
          fragmented, technical, and often assumed a level of stability I didn’t
          yet have.
        </p>

        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed max-w-none">
          National Debt Service was created to address that gap. It does not
          replace professional advice or services. Instead, it brings together
          reliable information and signposts to free, trusted support, so people
          can orient themselves before taking their next step.

        <h2>Who runs this site</h2>

        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed max-w-none">
          The site is run independently by a single owner. There are no links to
          debt management companies, lead generators, marketing agencies or
          claims firms. The aim is simple: give you a clear starting point
          without sales pressure.

        <h2>What changed with this domain</h2>

        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed max-w-none">
          In the past, this domain was used by a different organisation. They
          were reprimanded by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) for
          misleading people who were searching for debt help.
        </p>

        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed max-w-none">
          We are <strong>not connected</strong> to that organisation. The domain changed
          ownership after the ASA ruling. This version of National Debt Service is
          run with a completely different purpose and ethos.

        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed max-w-none">
          A clear banner at the top of the site explains this history so you can
          see at a glance that things are different now.

          When money worries build up, it can be hard to know where to start.
          There are lots of websites and adverts promising to “write off” debts
          or “wipe the slate clean”. That noise can make it harder to think
          straight.
