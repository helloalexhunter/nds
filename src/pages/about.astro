        <h1>What National Debt Service is here to do</h1>
        <p class="text-base text-slate-800 leading-relaxed max-w-none">
          National Debt Service is a small, independent website. It exists to point people in the UK
          to free, trusted debt advice and mental health support. We don’t sell products, handle
          your case or pass your details to anyone.

        <h2>Who runs this site</h2>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed max-w-none">
          The site is run independently by a single owner. There are no links to debt management
          companies, lead generators, marketing agencies or claims firms. The aim is simple: give
          you a clear starting point without sales pressure.

        <h2>What changed with this domain</h2>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed max-w-none">
          In the past, this domain was used by a different organisation. They were reprimanded by
          the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) for misleading people who were searching for
          debt help.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed max-w-none">
          We are <strong>not connected</strong> to that organisation. The domain changed ownership
          after the ASA ruling. This version of National Debt Service is run with a completely
          different purpose and ethos.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed max-w-none">
          We use a clear banner at the top of the site to explain this history so you can see at a
          glance that things are different now.

        <h2>What this site is for</h2>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed max-w-none">
          When money worries build up, it can be hard to know where to start. There are lots of
          websites and adverts promising to “write off” debts or “wipe the slate clean”. That noise
          can make it harder to think straight.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed max-w-none">
          This site takes a calmer approach. It:

          <li>uses plain English to explain common situations</li>
          <li>signposts to official and charity services in your country</li>
          <li>lists well-known, free and regulated debt advice organisations</li>
          <li>highlights mental health and crisis support alongside money help</li>
        </ul>

          To be clear about boundaries, this site does <strong>not</strong>:

        <h2>Countries in the UK</h2>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed max-w-none">
          Debt rules and court processes are not the same across the UK. England and Wales often
          share one set of rules, while Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own procedures,
          terms and timescales.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">
          That’s why the site always tries to:
        </p>
        <ul class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 max-w-none">
          <li>label which country each service or piece of information applies to</li>
          <li>link to country-specific versions of official guidance where possible</li>
          <li>encourage you to speak to a service that covers the country you live in</li>

        <h2>Accessibility and language</h2>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed max-w-none">
          Money worries often go hand in hand with stress, poor sleep, anxiety or low mood. When
          you feel like that, long or complicated pages can be hard to take in.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed max-w-none">
          The site aims to follow good accessibility practice, including:

          <li>clear headings and short sections</li>
          <li>high colour contrast for text and buttons</li>
          <li>font sizes that are easy to read on mobile and desktop</li>
