          These questions explain what this site is, what it is not, and why there is a notice at
          the top of the page. If you want links to real-world support, the{" "}
          <a href="/get-help">I need support now</a> page is the best place to start.

          Why is there a notice at the top of the page?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">
          The notice explains that the domain nationaldebtservice.co.uk used to be run by a
          different organisation. They were reprimanded by the Advertising Standards Authority
          (ASA) for misleading people who were looking for debt help. We want to be open about that
          history so you can see that things have changed.

        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">
          No. The current site is under new ownership and has no links to the previous operators.
          We don’t endorse the way they used the domain and we don’t run any of the services they
          promoted.

          What has changed since then?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">
          Everything. The owners, the purpose of the site, the content, the design and how data is
          handled. The current site:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed space-y-1">
          <li>does not advertise or sell debt solutions</li>
          <li>does not collect detailed debt information</li>
          <li>does not sell or share your data with third parties</li>
          <li>only signposts to trusted, free support</li>

          Are you a debt advice service?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">
          No. National Debt Service is not a debt advice service. It’s an information and
          signposting site. We don’t manage cases, speak to creditors or tell you which solution to
          choose.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">
          Are you regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">
          No. National Debt Service is not authorised by the FCA and doesn’t carry out regulated
          activities. That’s why we only provide general information and signposting, and always
          link you to free, regulated debt charities and official services for advice.

          Do you earn money if I use any of the links?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">
          No. We don’t earn commission, referral fees or advertising income if you contact any of
          the organisations we link to. The whole point of the site is to help you reach free,
          independent support without sales pressure.

          Do you collect my personal data?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">
          We only collect what we need to run the site and respond to messages you choose to send.
          That means:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed space-y-1">

          Who is this site for?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">
          The site is for adults in the UK who feel worried about money or debt and want a simple,
          safe place to start. It doesn’t replace speaking to a debt adviser, but it can help you
          find reliable organisations and understand who to contact first.

          What if I live outside the UK?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">
          This site focuses on the UK. Debt rules and support services are different in other
          countries. If you live elsewhere, it’s usually best to look for official government
          websites or well-known charities in your country that specialise in money and debt
          advice.

          If you spot a broken link, out-of-date information or something that feels unclear, you

          reports as quickly as we can and update pages when needed.
