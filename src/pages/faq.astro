          Here are some quick answers to common questions about this site. If you’re looking for
          help with debts or mental health, the <a href="/get-help">Where to get help</a> page is
          the best place to start.

          Are you a debt advice service?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">
          No. National Debt Service is not a debt advice service. It’s an information and
          signposting site. We don’t give you personal debt advice and we don’t manage cases, speak
          to creditors or arrange solutions.

          Are you regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">
          No. National Debt Service is not authorised by the FCA and doesn’t carry out regulated
          activities. That’s why we only provide general information and signposting, and always
          send you to free, regulated debt charities and official services for advice.

          I’m in serious trouble with debt. Can you tell me what to do?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">
          We know it’s hard when things feel urgent or frightening, but we can’t tell you what to
          do in your situation. The safest step is to speak to a free, regulated debt advice
          service in your country. You’ll find links on the <a href="/get-help">Where to get help</a>{" "}
          page.

          Do you get paid if I use any of the services you link to?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">
          No. We don’t earn commission or referral fees if you contact any of the organisations we
          link to. The whole point of the site is to point you towards free, independent help
          without sales pressure.

          Do you collect my personal data?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">
          We don’t run online forms or account systems, and we don’t ask you to enter details about
          your debts or income. Our hosting provider keeps basic technical logs, as explained in the{" "}
          <a href="/privacy">privacy notice</a>.

          Can I share this site with other people?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">
          Yes. If you know someone who’s struggling and wants a simple starting point, you can
          share the link to this site with them. Just be clear that it’s an information and
          signposting site, not a full advice service.
