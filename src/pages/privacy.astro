          This information is used to keep the site secure and to understand general traffic

          If you send us an email, we’ll see whatever you choose to include in that message. We use
          it only to read and respond to your query. Emails are stored in our email account and may
          be kept for a time as part of normal email records.

        <h2>Links to other websites</h2>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">
          Most links on this site go to other organisations, such as debt charities or mental
          health services. When you follow one of those links, their own privacy policy and cookie
          policy will apply. We don’t control how other sites use your data.

        <h2>Your rights</h2>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">
          Depending on where you live, you may have rights over your personal data, such as the
          right to ask for a copy of information held about you or to ask for it to be corrected.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">
          Because this site processes very little personal data, these rights will usually only be
          relevant if you’ve emailed us or otherwise contacted us directly.
